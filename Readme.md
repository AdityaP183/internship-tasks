# Internship Tasks

## Introduction

During my internship, I worked on a series of tasks aimed at building and improving various projects related to full-stack web development. The tasks ranged from simple html form to server side rendering, front-end implementation using React to backend development, API integration, and data management. Each task provided an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills.

## Folder Structure

To keep the project well-organized and easily navigable, I grouped tasks into categories based on their relevance and relation to each other. This structure ensures clarity and helps to maintain a logical flow across the different tasks.
Every folder has a readme file explaining the task and it's implementation.
